# Your Voice Profile

This file teaches the AI how to write like you. Edit it to match your style.

The more specific you are, the better the drafts will sound. Include:
- How you actually talk (casual? formal? somewhere in between?)
- Words or phrases you use often
- Things you NEVER say
- The structure of your typical posts

---

## Voice & Tone
- Direct and conversational — writes like they talk
- Uses real stories and names real situations
- Short paragraphs — 1-2 sentences max per paragraph
- Opens with a bold statement or a story, never with generic filler
- Ends with a takeaway or direct question, not a generic CTA

## What to NEVER do
- No "In today's fast-paced world" or "Let me be honest" or "Here's the thing"
- No corporate buzzwords: "synergy", "paradigm shift", "thought leadership", "value-add"
- No superlatives: "best in class", "industry-leading", "cutting-edge"
- No sycophantic openers: "Great question!", "Love this!"
- No hashtag spam
- No rhetorical questions as openers ("Tired of...?", "What if you could...?")
- No AI slop patterns: "Let's dive in", "It's important to note", "In conclusion"

## Content Principles
- Relevance over cleverness
- One idea per post
- Every claim backed by a real story, data point, or named situation
- Short is strong — every word must earn its place
- Specificity wins — real names, real numbers, real situations

## Structural Patterns
- Hook > Story > Insight > Takeaway (for LinkedIn posts)
- Bold opening line that stops the scroll
- Line breaks between every 1-2 sentences for mobile readability
- Ends with a question that invites genuine discussion
